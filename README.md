### Project Description
FruityTalk is a chatbot that replies only in random fruit facts ‚Äî even when your question has nothing to do with fruits. It's interactive, mildly educational, but 100% useless in solving your actual problem.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are suffering from a severe lack of unexpected fruit knowledge while trying to ask serious questions.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A chatbot that ignores your topic entirely and responds with bizarre fruit facts, trivia, and jokes, ensuring you leave both confused and strangely informed about pineapples.
