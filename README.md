Project Description
FruityTalk is a humorous, interactive web application that lets users chat with emotionally unstable cartoon fruits‚Äîincluding Banana, Apple, Mango, Pineapple, and Watermelon. Designed purely for fun, it‚Äôs a playful, pastel-themed chat where each fruit has its own unique personality and mood swings.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The world is desperately lacking a dedicated space to have meaningful conversations with fruits that are emotionally unstable. Millions suffer daily from not being able to express themselves to a judgmental Apple or a melodramatic Banana.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We present FruityTalk: a fully-featured, over-engineered chat platform where you can select your favorite fruit and argue, laugh, and ponder life‚Äôs big questions with them. Change fruits on the fly, enjoy silly banter, and even hear your fruity friend talk back‚Äîwith moods, animations, and completely unnecessary drama.
